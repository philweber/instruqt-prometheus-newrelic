title: Configuring the Prometheus Remote Write Integration
teaser: Learn how simple it is to send your Prometheus metric data to New Relic, and
  visualize it in Grafana
description: |-
  The Prometheus remote write integration allows you to forward [telemetry data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-started/capabilities/get-know-telemetry-data-platform/) from your existing Prometheus servers to New Relic. Once integrated, you can leverage the full range of options for setup and management, from raw data to queries, dashboards, and more.

  ## Scale your data and get moving quickly
  With the Prometheus remote write integration, you can:

  - Store and visualize crucial metrics on a single platform
  - Combine and group data across your entire software stack
  - Get a fully-connected view of the relationship between data about your software stack and the behaviors and outcomes you’re monitoring
  - Connect your Grafana dashboards (optional).

  title: Explore the Pet Clinic Sample Application
  teaser: Click around the Pet Clinic application to generate some metric data
  assignment: |-
    To start the Pet Clinic application, click on the _Terminal_ tab and enter the following command: `./start.sh`. Wait about 3 minutes, then click on the _Pet Clinic App_ tab.

    Click around the Pet Clinic application to generate some metric data.

    - Click on _Veterinarians_ to view a list of the doctors in our clinic
    - Click on _Owners_, then _All_ to browse a list of pet owners
    - Select an owner to view their information
    - Try adding or editing an owner or a pet, or adding a visit for a pet

    When you’re done, click the _Check_ button below.

      In later challenges, you will configure Prometheus to send its metrics to New Relic. After you do so, you will be able to see Prometheus metric data flowing into your New Relic account. Finally, you will configure Grafana to use New Relic as a data source for a dashboard.

    an open source, multi-platform visualization tool. Let’s take a look at our Prometheus

  teaser: Log into your New Relic account and see if it is receiving metric data from
    Prometheus
  assignment: |-
    Confirm that Prometheus metrics are _not_ currently flowing into your New Relic account:

    1. Click the _Open external window_ button to the left. [New Relic One](https://one.newrelic.com/) will open in a new browser tab
    2. Log into your New Relic account. (If you don’t have an account, you may create a free one [here](http://nru.to/new))
    3. From the top menu bar, select _Query your data_
    4. Make sure your account is selected from the dropdown list of accounts
    5. Select the _Query builder_ tab, and NRQL mode if necessary
    6. Execute the following NRQL query: `SELECT * FROM Metric WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'prometheus'`

    The query should return no data. In the next challenge, we will configure Prometheus to send data to New Relic.

  assignment: "To get Prometheus to send its metric data to New Relic, follow these
    steps: \n\n1. Read the documentation in the _Remote Write Instructions_ tab. When
    you click the _Add Prometheus data_ button, the remote write setup launcher will
    open in a new browser tab\n\n2. Complete the setup launcher and note your data
    source name and license key, then return to this page\n\n3. Click on the _Prometheus
    Configuration File_ tab and select the file name. Uncomment the remote write configuration
    lines at the bottom of the file by deleting the hash symbol (#) **and space**
    from the beginning of each line\n\n4. Replace the YOUR_DATA_SOURCE_NAME and YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
    placeholders with your values from step 2. If you prefer, you may delete the commented
    lines and copy and paste the lines from the remote write setup launcher\n\n5.
    Save your changes by clicking the disk icon on the editor tab\n\n6. Finally, click
    on the _Terminal_ tab and execute the following command to restart Prometheus:

      New Relic is a fully-managed Saas platform** \n\nIf you run Prometheus yourself,

      infrastructure. With New Relic, we take care of that for you."

      day (think Black Friday), your self-managed Prometheus infrastructure may not

      capacity to handle your busiest day; the rest of the time it sits unused. New
      Relic is built to scale dynamically; we can handle your busiest day, but you
      pay only for what you actually use.\n\nLet’s see how easy it is to send Prometheus
      data to New Relic."
